        <p>
          International Conference on Innovations in Computational Intelligence
          and Computer Vision 2024 invites original research contribution from
          different fields as mentioned in topics provided that the context of
          the work is clearly explained. Papers must be submitted on or before
          the last date of paper submission. After this deadline, you will not
          be able to register new papers, however you will be able to edit the
          information of existing submitted papers.
        </p>
        <h3>Submission Guidelines:</h3>
        <p>
          All submissions will be handled electronically using Microsoft’s CMT
          platform. Authors are hereby instructed not to submit any paper via
          emails directly. By submitting a paper, the authors agree to the
          policies of ICICV-2024. It is the primary author’s responsibility to
          add the details of all authors (e.g., co-authors) of the paper to the
          CMT portal so that important updates about your papers can be sent to
          all authors. While submitting the paper, the corresponding author must
          include at least one primary area to which your paper belongs. Once
          you submit your paper, you will be assigned a unique paper ID. Please
          remember this paper ID and quote that ID in all further
          communications.
        </p>

        <h3>Confidentiality:</h3>
        <p>
          The review process of the conference will be strictly confidential.
          The practice of keeping all information confidential during the review
          is part of the standard communication at ICICV. Misuse of confidential
          information is a severe professional failure and appropriate measures
          will be taken when brought to the attention of the Conference
          Organizers. It should be noted that the Conference Organizers will not
          be responsible for the consequences when reviewers break
          confidentiality.
        </p>
        <h3>Review Process:</h3>
        <p>
          By submitting a paper to the conference, the authors agree to our
          single blind review process and understand that papers will be peer
          reviewed by our expert reviewers after checking of plagiarism from a
          plagiarism checking software (preferably “Turnitin”). Authors are
          required to submit the revised version of the manuscript as per review
          comments mentioned in the acceptance E-mail. Authors may be asked to
          undergo further revision(s) to their manuscript before final
          publication even after Conference.
        </p>
        <h3>Plagiarism:</h3>
        <p>
          ICICV-2024 respects Intellectual Property Rights. Plagiarism consists
          of wrong appropriation of someone’s content, thoughts, ideas by
          representing as one’s original work. This type of violation of ethical
          principles will not be entertained by the conference at any cost. It
          should be noted that papers having more than 18% similarity will not
          be processed, hence they will be summarily rejected. For a single
          source, the similarity index should not be greater than 2%.
        </p>
        <h3>Dual/Double Submissions:</h3>
        <p>
          The goals of our conference are to publish exciting new work for the
          first time and to avoid duplicating the effort of reviewers. By
          submitting a manuscript to the conference, authors acknowledge that it
          has not been previously published or accepted for publication in
          substantially similar form in any peer-reviewed venue. Violation of
          any of these conditions will lead to rejection and will be reported to
          the other venue to which the submission was sent. Any submission to
          the conference should not overlap with prior publications or other
          concurrent submissions. If you need to cite a different paper of yours
          that is being submitted concurrently to the conference, the authors
          should cite these papers, argue in the body of your paper why your
          paper is non-trivially different from these concurrent submissions;
          and include those papers in the supplemental material. Authors are
          encouraged to contact the Program Chairs about any clarifications.
        </p>
        <h3>Attendance Responsibilities:</h3>
        <p>
          The authors agree that if the paper is accepted, at least one of the
          authors will register for the conference and present the paper there.
          Acceptance of a paper does not claim for final publication. Only
          presented papers will be forwarded to publication partner. Presenters
          will be provided certificate of paper presentation.
        </p>
        <h3>Publication:</h3>
        <p>
          All accepted and presented papers will be submitted for publication to
          our publication partner (preferable in a SCOPUS indexed proceedings).
          Before final publication, the publication partner may send the proofs
          to the corresponding author. Make sure the email id of corresponding
          author is correctly mentioned in the manuscript. Keep visiting
          conference website for more updates regarding publication details.
