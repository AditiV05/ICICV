              Manipal University Jaipur (MUJ) was launched in 2011 on an
              invitation from the Government of Rajasthan, as a self-financed
              State University. MUJ has redefined academic excellence in the
              region, with the Manipal way of learning; one that inspires
              students of all disciplines to learn and innovate through hands-on
              practical experience.
